# Text Classification and Topic Modeling with NLP

This project was developed as part of the "Intelligent Data and Text Analytics" coursework. It applies natural language processing techniques to classify Amazon product reviews and identify hidden topics in the text data.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `IDTA CW1 UP2270587.ipynb` ‚Äì Main notebook containing all text preprocessing, classification models, BERT implementation, and topic modeling.
- `README.md` ‚Äì Project overview and setup instructions.
- `.gitignore` ‚Äì To prevent unwanted files from being tracked.
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äì *(Optional)* List of dependencies used in the notebook.

## üìù Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Text Preprocessing
- Lowercasing
- Removing punctuation, numbers, and stopwords
- Lemmatization
- Examples before/after preprocessing provided

### Task 2: Traditional Text Classification
Used **Bag-of-Words (BoW)** representation with three algorithms:
- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Multinomial Naive Bayes

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

### Task 3: BERT-Based Classification
Used pre-trained **BERT** model with fine-tuning to classify the same Amazon reviews. Compared BERT results with traditional classifiers.

### Task 4: Topic Detection
Applied **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** to detect **10 topics** from the corpus. Topics are visualized and quality assessed.

## üìä Results Snapshot

| Model                  | Accuracy |
|------------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression    | ~83%     |
| SVM                    | ~85%     |
| Naive Bayes            | ~79%     |
| **BERT (Fine-tuned)**  | **92%**  |

### Example Topics (LDA)
1. Camera, lens, image, quality, photo  
2. Battery, life, charge, power, long  
...
